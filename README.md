=====================

Bundle of utilities to make your TypeScript + Express REST services simple and well organized.

---
* Register all your routes using TypeScript decorators, ie. @Path, @Get, @Post, @Put, and so on.
* No need to import your controllers. All you have to do is to init the application and then the api will look for all decorated classes.
* Built-in response handler, to increase your productivity and give you a pattern.
* REST services initialized in an easy way using decorators, however you will have the Request, Response and Next arguments as usual, giving you more freedom.
